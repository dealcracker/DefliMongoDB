These scripts are compatible with the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and 23.04 as well as Rasberry Pi OS. The current recommended OS from Defli Networks is Ubuntu 22.04.

## Troubleshooting

### Service Failed To Start
If the MongoBD service does not start at the end of the MongoBD install script, try restarting the service.
```
sudo systemctl start adsb_collector
```
If the service still does not run, try rebooting the device. 
```
sudo reboot
```
Then check the service status again
```
sudo systemctl status adsb_collector
```

### Update your OS
If you are seeing errors while running the scripts, it may be helpful to update your device OS. 

```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
